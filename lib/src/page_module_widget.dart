  ///
  /// The given [BuildContext] contains information about the location in the

  /// arguments over time if the widget is moved around the tree or if the

  /// * any ambient state obtained from the `context` using

  /// The given [BuildContext] contains information about the location in the
  /// tree at which this widget is being built. For example, the context
  /// provides the set of inherited widgets for this location in the tree. The
  /// [BuildContext] argument is always the same as the [context] property of
  /// this [State] object and will remain the same for the lifetime of this
  /// object. The [BuildContext] argument is provided redundantly here so that
  /// this method matches the signature for a [WidgetBuilder].
  ///
  /// ## Design discussion
  ///
  /// ### Why is the [build] method on [State], and not [StatefulWidget]?
  ///
  /// Putting a `Widget build(BuildContext context)` method on [State] rather
  /// than putting a `Widget build(BuildContext context, State state)` method
  /// on [StatefulWidget] gives developers more flexibility when subclassing
  /// [StatefulWidget].
  ///
  /// For example, [AnimatedWidget] is a subclass of [StatefulWidget] that
  /// introduces an abstract `Widget build(BuildContext context)` method for its
  /// subclasses to implement. If [StatefulWidget] already had a [build] method
  /// that took a [State] argument, [AnimatedWidget] would be forced to provide
  /// its [State] object to subclasses even though its [State] object is an
  /// internal implementation detail of [AnimatedWidget].
  ///
  /// Conceptually, [StatelessWidget] could also be implemented as a subclass of
  /// [StatefulWidget] in a similar manner. If the [build] method were on
  /// [StatefulWidget] rather than [State], that would not be possible anymore.
  ///
  /// Putting the [build] function on [State] rather than [StatefulWidget] also
  /// helps avoid a category of bugs related to closures implicitly capturing
  /// `this`. If you defined a closure in a [build] function on a
  /// [StatefulWidget], that closure would implicitly capture `this`, which is
  /// the current widget instance, and would have the (immutable) fields of that
  /// instance in scope:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// class MyButton extends StatefulWidget {
  ///   ...
  ///   final Color color;
  ///
  ///   @override
  ///   Widget build(BuildContext context, MyButtonState state) {
  ///     ... () { print("color: $color"); } ...
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// For example, suppose the parent builds `MyButton` with `color` being blue,
  /// the `$color` in the print function refers to blue, as expected. Now,
  /// suppose the parent rebuilds `MyButton` with green. The closure created by
  /// the first build still implicitly refers to the original widget and the
  /// `$color` still prints blue even through the widget has been updated to
  /// green.
  ///
  /// In contrast, with the [build] function on the [State] object, closures
  /// created during [build] implicitly capture the [State] instance instead of
  /// the widget instance:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// class MyButtonState extends State<MyButton> {
  ///   ...
  ///   @override
  ///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  ///     ... () { print("color: ${widget.color}"); } ...
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Now when the parent rebuilds `MyButton` with green, the closure created by
  /// the first build still refers to [State] object, which is preserved across
  /// rebuilds, but the framework has updated that [State] object's [widget]
  /// property to refer to the new `MyButton` instance and `${widget.color}`
  /// prints green, as expected.
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  ///  * [StatefulWidget], which contains the discussion on performance considerations.
